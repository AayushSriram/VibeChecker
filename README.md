## About
This project would involve building a framework to transmit health data collected by a user's phone to a database that would be interpreted into real-time data for specified medical professionals. This would help medical professionals get more accurate/frequent readings from their patients without having to schedule constant visits, saving hassle for both parties.

## Business Model
I would sell the skills required to install, use, and maintain this software as a service (either directly or training for a certification), rather than the software itself. People would still be able to make contributions to the code and freely modify it as per the open source model.

## License
I used the GNU GPL v3 license because I want to have collaborators without any issues of getting harassed by patent claims, no matter how bogus they are (if software like this takes off, inevitably they will come up). Also, since the license requires anyone who decides to publicly release a modified version of my project to release their source code as well, I would be able to look at changes made from that as inspiration for my own distribution.
